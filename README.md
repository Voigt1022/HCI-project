# Finding a Career Path - Project 7
Project 8 (task 2)
This project includes a multisteop task in the P8 file. The first page is a home page. This homepage will be the first page after the "create user account" page. 
The homepage will include:
  Log In functionality
  Start Quiz button
  View Results button
Our task will ask the user to navigate from the homepage to the start quiz. This will take us to our second page. This page will look like a normal questionnaire/quiz interface. (This will include linked pages with 5 questions on each page). There will be previous and next buttons to navigate through the quiz pages as well as a bar on the left hand side to demonstrate progress to the user. Once a section is completed, it will be shaded green to show that it is finished. At the end of the quiz (questions 15-20), there will be a submit button to finish the questionnaire. This submit button will link to the results summary page.

Updated Project 7 (task 3)
We also updated code in the P7 file. This will include updates that user testing brought up last week. 
These changes include: 
  alt tags for the detailed results page buttons for accessibility purposes
  insert a back button on the detailed results page to summary results on detailed results page
  think about maybe highlighting the results on the summary page to make it easier for users to understand where to click for the detailed results
